This will be a group of scripts for cyberpatriot

written by yours truly Landon Snellgrove

So far just contains a windows audit tool and linux audit tool not sure if it works or not

For the linux audit you might have to self compile.

The linux audit tool is also untested so far

command to compile should be

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o linux_audit path_to_scripts/cp_audit_windows.cpp
```
